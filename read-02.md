# Read: 02 - jQuery, Events, and The DOM

## jQuery: 

* jQuery is a JavaScript file you include in your pages.

* Once included, it makes it faster and easier to write cross-browser JavaScript, based on two steps:
  1 Using CSS-style selectors to collect one or more nodes from the DOM tree.
  2 Using jQuery's built-in methods to work with the elements in that selection.

* jQuery's CSS-style selector syntax makes it easier to select elements to work with. It also has methods that make it easier to traverse the DOM.
* jQuery makes it easier to handle events because the event methods work across all browsers.
* jQuery offers methods that make it quick and simple to achieve a range of tasks that JavaScript programmers commonly need to perform.


## Common Events

* The following are the most commonly used events:

* ***Mouse Events:***

`click` occurs when an element is clicked.

`dblclick` occurs when an element is double-clicked.

`mouseenter` occurs when the mouse pointer is over (enters) the selected element.

`mouseleave` occurs when the mouse pointer leaves the selected element.

`mouseover` occurs when the mouse pointer is over the selected element.


* ***Keyboard Events:***

`input`

`keydown` occurs when a keyboard key is pressed down.

`keyup` occurs when a keyboard key is released.


* ***Form Events:***

`submit` occurs when a form is submitted.

`change` occurs when the value of an element has been changed.

`focus` occurs when an element gets focus.

`blur` occurs when an element loses focus.

`select`

* ***Document Events:***

`ready` occurs when the DOM has been loaded.

`resize` occurs when the browser window changes size.

`scroll` occurs when the user scrolls in the specified element.
