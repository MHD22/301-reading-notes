# Read: 03 - Flexbox and Templating

## Javascript Templating:

* Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. 
* The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.
* The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

## Mustache (logic-less templates):

* Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. 
* It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.
* It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops.
* Instead, there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.
* mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. And, since mustache supports various languages, we don’t need a separate templating system on the server side.

## Flexbox:

* The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.

## Why Flexbox?

* For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were things like floats and positioning. These are fine, and they work, but in some ways they are also rather limiting and frustrating.

* The following simple layout requirements are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools, in any kind of convenient, flexible way:

  * Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
  * Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
  * Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.
