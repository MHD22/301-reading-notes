# Read: 08 - SQL

#### _____________________________________________

## What is SQL?

* SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.
* And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

## Relational databases

* Before learning the SQL syntax, it's important to have a model for what a relational database actually is.
* A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables.
* Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.


* **For example, if the Department of Motor Vehicles had a database, you might find a table containing all the known vehicles that people in the state are driving. This table might need to store the model name, type, number of wheels, and number of doors of each vehicle for example.**

## Why learn SQL:

* By learning SQL, the goal is to learn how to answer specific questions about this data, like "What types of vehicles are on the road have less than four wheels?", or "How many models of cars does Tesla produce?", to help us make better decisions down the road.
