## SMACSS:

* SMACSS (pronounced “smacks”) is more style guide than rigid framework.
* There is no library within here for you to download or install. 
* SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process. 
* It is an attempt to document a consistent approach to site development when using CSS. 
* And really, who isn’t building a site with CSS these days?! Feel free to take this in its entirety or use only the parts that work best for you. 
* Or don’t use it at all. I understand that this won’t be everybody’s cup of tea. When it comes to web development, the answer to most questions is “it depends”.

## What is “Float”?


* Float is a CSS positioning property. 
* To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design. In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed. 
* floats can be used to create entire web layouts. 
* Float’s sister property is `clear`. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. 
* Again an illustration probably does more good than words do. 
* One of the most frequent uses of the clear property is “clear:both”.This allows you to reset the flow of elements, as opposed to continuing to maintain a right, left and normal flow.
