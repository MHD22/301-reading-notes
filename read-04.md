# Read: 04 - Responsive Web Design and Regular Expressions

## Responsive Web Design (CSS Grid):

* CSS grid is now supported in Samsung internet v6.2 and many other modern browsers and has been the answer to many a prayer of web developers everywhere. 
* In the same way that flexbox gave us a way to layout block elements next to each other, CSS grid lets us not only arrange elements in a row or a column, but in multiple rows and columns. 
* Finally two dimensional layouts are becoming simpler!

* CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. 
* It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. 
* You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) and to that element’s children (which become Grid Items).

## Regular Excepressions:

* Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of ASCII or unicode characters).

* Fields of application range from validation to parsing/replacing strings, passing through translating data to other formats and web scraping.

* One of the most interesting features is that once you’ve learned the syntax, you can actually use this tool in (almost) all programming languages ​​(JavaScript, Java, VB, C #, C / C++, Python, Perl, Ruby, Delphi, R, Tcl, and many others) with the slightest distinctions about the support of the most advanced features and syntax versions supported by the engines).


***The application fields of regex can be multiple and I’m sure that you’ve recognized at least one of these tasks among those seen in your developer career, here a quick list:***

* data validation (for example check if a time string i well-formed)
* data scraping (especially web scraping, find all pages that contain a certain set of words eventually in a specific order)
* data wrangling (transform data from “raw” to another format)
* string parsing (for example catch all URL GET parameters, capture text inside a set of parenthesis)
* string replacement (for example, even during a code session using a common IDE to translate a Java or C# class in the respective JSON object — replace “;” with “,” make it lowercase, avoid type declaration, etc.)
* syntax highlightning, file renaming, packet sniffing and many other applications involving strings (where data need not be textual)
